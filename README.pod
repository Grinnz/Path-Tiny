Path::Tiny - File path utility

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Path::Tiny;

  my $file = path("/foo/bar");

  ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module attempts to provide a small, fast utility for working with
file paths.  It is friendlier to use than raw L<File::Spec> and provides
easy access to functions from several other core file handling modules.

It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as L<IO::All> or L<Path::Class>,
nor does it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32 platforms.

It tries to be fast, with as minimal overhead over File::Spec as possible.

All paths are converted to Unix-style forward slashes.
